Here's the revised version with some small improvements:

Hi,

I am Hariharan Ravi.

In this assessment, I have used the following stack:

- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind for responsiveness
- Vite for bundling
- ChartJS as required

HOW TO RUN
To keep the project submission size within the limit, I have removed the node_modules folder.

- Run 'npm install'
- Run 'npm run dev'
This will start the application.

I have also hosted the site at this link:
https://hari-init.github.io/coalition/

This assessment is fully responsive, from mobile to large screens.
For API authentication, I have used an API key.

Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,
Hariharan Ravi
